                            <p class="about-history first">The modern idea of a restaurant – as well as the term itself
                                – appeared in Paris in the 18th century. For centuries Paris had taverns which served
                                food at large common tables, but they were notoriously crowded, noisy, not very clean,
                                and served food of dubious quality. In about 1765 a new kind of eating establishment,
                                called a "Bouillon", was opened on rue des Poulies, near the Louvre, by a man named
                                Boulanger.<br/> <br>
                                It had separate tables, a menu, and specialized in soups made with a base of meat and
                                eggs, which were said to be restaurants or, in English "restoratives". Other similar
                                bouillons soon opened around Paris.

                                    category of ordinary food. Their existence was predicated on health, not gustatory,
                                    requirements.</p>
