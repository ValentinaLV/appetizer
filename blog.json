For me, it\u2019s always a mix of creamy polenta + roasted veggies + beans + some sort of punchy sauce.\r\n\r\nYou all could have probably guessed that based on the number of times I\u2019ve shared a polenta recipe (what can I say? I\u2019m obsessed) but lately I\u2019ve found an additional obsession: gremolata. It\u2019s bright and citrusy and really adds a vibrant flare to what could otherwise be a pretty boring dish. Plus, it\u2019s so versatile! Traditionally it\u2019s made with parsley and citrus zest but if you don\u2019t have those on hand, why not swap in other fresh herbs and citrus zest? Cilantro and lime? Yes, please. Mint and orange? Why not? A mix of all of those things? Heck yes!\r\n\r\nI used rainbow carrots for my roasted veggies because, again, that is what I had on hand but I also love roasting sweet potatoes, onions, and bell peppers if that is what you have. Just make sure that you are cutting your potatoes and carrots into smaller pieces than your onions and bell peppers because they will take longer to roast.\r\n\r\nI also am calling this gremolata a citrus gremolata since I\u2019m using more than lemon zest. The addition of the orange zest really bring out a vibrant punch to keep each bite interesting and addictive!", "created_date": "2020-01-16T20:07:29Z", "author": 2, "category": 5, "image": "posts/post_1.jpg", "slug": "roasted-veggies-with-citrus-gremolata-and-polenta-1579207949", "tags": [6, 1, 3, 2]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Buffalo Cauliflower Bowl with Greek Yogurt Ranch and Spicy Quick Slaw", "content": "I\u2019m going to go ahead and guess that you are here today because you got your fill on holiday sweets and are ready for something a little bit healthier?

All the components are easy to make ahead of time (just warm up the cauliflower and grains when ready to eat) so making a healthy meal has never been easier.\r\n\r\nI happened to have had a batch of rice already made when I shot this bowl so it\u2019s what I used but I also love this bowl with quinoa for an extra protein boost. And if you need even more protein, I bet some stew-y black beans would work great with this to give it a Mexican-burrito-bowl-vibe.\r\n\r\nFor the slaw, I used pickled jalapenos as I find them to blend better into the overall flavor of the acidic slaw but you could use fresh if you like things extra spicy.", "created_date": "2020-01-16T20:16:47Z", "author": 2, "category": 4, "image": "posts/post_2.jpg", "slug": "buffalo-cauliflower-bowl-with-greek-yogurt-ranch-and-spicy-quick-slaw-1579207946", "tags": []}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Cardamom Orange Sour Cream Cookies with Candied Citrus Peel", "content": "Dang! Christmas is SIX days away? Where did December go?? Can I be honest with you? This holiday season went by so fast that we didn\u2019t even get around to putting our tree up (eep!). And I\u2019m not even close to being done with my holiday shopping. The one thing I did make sure I got around too though was making holiday cookies because, OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE HOLIDAY COOKIES! What was that? You didn\u2019t make any yet this year? Fear not because there is still time this weekend to whip up a batch and may I suggest you start with these Cardamom Orange Sour Cream cookies? Think sugar cookies but without the rolling out and chilling and with a pillowy texture and a slight tang.\r\n\r\nPeople talk about moments sticking with them from their childhood \u2013 usually a movie that made an impact or maybe dancing to a favorite song. But a moment I remember vividly from when I was 11 was biting into a pillowy soft cookie that my teacher made and I was floored at how delicious it was. I begged to know what the secret was and you know what she said? Sour cream. Right then and there I made a mental note that I loved sour cream cookies. Now that I\u2019m an adult and have control of my own kitchen, I\u2019ve added sour cream cookies to my normal holiday cookie rotation (and think you probably should too!).\r\n\r\nI used Bob\u2019s Red Mill All-Purpose flour and Almond Flour in this recipe. The little bit of almond flour helps yield a tender cookie and gives it a slightly nutty flavor. You could use festive holiday sprinkles instead of citrus if you didn\u2019t want to make the candied citrus but it brings together the flavors nicely since there is also orange in the cookie. Finally, make sure you let the cookies cool completely before adding the frosting so the frosting doesn\u2019t melt off the cookie.", "created_date": "2020-01-16T20:17:38Z", "author": 2, "category": 2, "image": "posts/post_3.jpg", "slug": "cardamom-orange-sour-cream-cookies-with-candied-citrus-peel-1579207943", "tags": [6, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5]}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Cauliflower Parmesan", "content": "It\u2019s the holiday season (hoop-dee-dooooo!) which means endless cookie trays, gingerbread house building, and holiday party drinking galore!

I don\u2019t know about you but I always wake up craving vegetables after a weekend of sweets and one too many punch bowl cocktails. \r\n\r\nAll of this is to say that I\u2019m excited to partner with Lucini Italia on this post to bring you all a veg-packed healthy vegetarian main to enjoy between all the cookie binging. It\u2019s simple enough to enjoy on a weeknight and goes great with a simple side salad. \r\n\r\nThis recipe is inspired by an Italian classic \u2013 Eggplant Parmesan. The classic isn\u2019t very winter-friendly (eggplants and basil in December? Not ideal) so I decided to make a version great for all year round with cauliflower \u201csteaks\u201d and heartier herbs like thyme and oregano. But fear, not Eggplant Parmesan purists, it is still chocked full of the best part: cheese and more cheese!\r\n\r\nI used Lucini Italia\u2019s Organic Roasted Garlic Marinara in this recipe which I was pleasantly surprised to learn, through working with them on this post, is made using all organic ingredients from one organic tomato farm in Tuscany. It also has no added sugar which is something I\u2019m always looking for when buying store-bought items. I also found the sauce to be lighter and taste fresher than other store tomato sauces I\u2019ve purchased before. This is because they use a cooked-once technique which is a rare industry process that allows the ingredients to maintain their fresh flavor (this is in comparison to the cooked-twice method which many brands utilize and involves having the tomatoes cooked/processed when harvested and then cooked/processed again months later when adding additional ingredients). \r\n\r\nIn addition to the organic sauce, I used Lucini Italia\u2019s extra virgin olive oil which you can learn more behind the bottle here. I always love seeing exactly where my food is coming from!\r\n\r\nTo ensure the cauliflower doesn\u2019t fall apart, you need to make pretty thick cuts to create the \u201csteaks\u201d \u2013 I\u2019d recommend at least an inch.

The beautiful pink hue will steal the show of any appetizer table at your holiday gathering!\r\n\r\nThis Butternut Squash Hummus with Brown Butter & Fried Sage is a stellar fall or winter appetizer and snack. The nutty brown butter gives an extra flavor punch to the already rich hummus. It\u2019s an *almost* make-ahead appetizer because you can make this hummus ahead of time and then just brown the butter and sage right before your guests to arrive.\r\n\r\nThis White Bean Buffalo Hummus is a healthy protein-packed afternoon snack or spread for any meal. Using white beans to create a creamy hummus is the secret to being able to cut back on oil in this recipe. This hummus can also be made ahead of time with toppings added right before serving.\r\n\r\nThis Smoky Pumpkin & Black Sesame Seed Hummus is the perfect fall appetizer or an easy dinner with a side of chopped veggies and chips.\r\n\r\nIf you like an extra crunch in your hummus this than Coriander Hummus is for you!\r\n\r\nSweet Potato Hummus is a fun twist with roasted sweet potatoes blended right into the hummus.\r\n\r\nThis Spicy Corn Jalape\u00f1o Hummus would be perfect for a summer dinner when corn is in season but using frozen corn during the holidays will also work for this recipe.

Hangar 1\u2019s Honeycomb Vodka is infused with actual honeycomb (not just honey!) so the finished flavor is vibrant and unique.

Plus, the packaging of this vodka is so gorgeous that I love showing it off by keeping it on the table for guests to ask about.\r\n\r\nAs for the crostini, you can roast the sweet potatoes a few hours ahead of time and pop them back in the oven to warm up slightly before serving. The same goes for preparing the bread pieces ahead of time. When ready to serve, pile your bread high with sweet potatoes, cheese, fresh sage, and then drizzle the honey. Alternatively, you could leave the honey on the side and let guests drizzle it themselves if you\u2019d like to let them pick their level of sweetness.\r\n\r\nNow invite some friends over for cocktails and snacks and get cooking!", "created_date": "2020-01-16T20:24:58Z", "author": 2, "category": 6, "image": "posts/post_6.jpg", "slug": "sweet-potato-gorgonzola-crostini-honey-gimlet-1579207919", "tags": [6, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5]}}, {"model": "blog.category", "pk": 1, "fields": {"category_name": "RECIPES"}}, {"model": "blog.category", "pk": 2, "fields": {"category_name": "VEGETARIAN"}}, {"model": "blog.category", "pk": 3, "fields": {"category_name": "SNACK"}}, {"model": "blog.category", "pk": 4, "fields": {"category_name": "SALAD"}}, {"model": "blog.category", "pk": 5, "fields": {"category_name": "DINNER"}}, {"model": "blog.category", "pk": 6, "fields": {"category_name": "HOLIDAY"}}, {"model": "blog.tag", "pk": 1, "fields": {"title": "cooking", "slug": "cooking"}}, {"model": "blog.tag", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "kitchen", "slug": "kitchen"}}, {"model": "blog.tag", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "food", "slug": "food"}}, {"model": "blog.tag", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "dinner", "slug": "dinner"}}, {"model": "blog.tag", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "lunch", "slug": "lunch"}}, {"model": "blog.tag", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "breakfast", "slug": "breakfast"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 1, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 1, "content": "Very nice post.", "created_date": "2020-01-17T11:42:00Z"}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 2, "fields": {"user": 2, "post": 1, "content": "So many delicious choices!
